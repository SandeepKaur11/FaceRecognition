***Face Recognition

Facial Recognition software has been increasingly deployed by many countries to secure access and improve surveillance, especially during the pandemic. Facial recognition systems involve the identification of people from a database of images, including still photographs and videos. 
This Approach to the detect and identification of human faces is presented and a working system which tracks a person’s head and then recognizes the person by comparing characteristics of the face to those of data available for the individual is described.  

It treats face recognition as a two dimensional recognition problem, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus can be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. Face images are projected onto a feature space (face space) that best encodes the variation among known face images. These feature space is defined by the ‘Eigenfaces’. This framework provides the ability to learn to recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner.
